# YappariExplorer

A cross-platform multi-threaded File Explorer written in C++17 using the Qt framework, currently supporting Windows and Linux. It's based on the Model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.

YappariExplorer can be used as single pane, or dual pane horizontally or vertically. It also supports multiple tabs pero pane. Currently in its alpha phase only supports detailed view.

What makes YappariExplorer different than any other File Manager is that it's optimized for speed, where all the I/O communications are done in the background so the GUI is always responsive.
